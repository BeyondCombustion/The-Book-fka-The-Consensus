# Herbs That Care

Aromatherapy is simply the process of using natural oils or herbs to enhance a person’s psychological and physical well-being, and we at DaVinci are all for making other people’s well-being better.

The aromatherapy herbs DaVinci offers claim to be known to have benefits that help treat certain ailments - also they say they are really good for you. Did you know that Chamomile helps boost the immune system? Or that Wild Lettuce relieves headache? If you have not tried any of these aromatherapy herbs, you owe it to yourself to try one or many combined to tap into benefits that you may have been looking for but haven’t seen a great result with. Some of these herbs can truly help you get the most out of your vaping experience, plus you can feel good about it – literally!
