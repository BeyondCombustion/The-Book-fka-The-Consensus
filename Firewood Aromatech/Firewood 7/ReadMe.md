## The Firewood 7 is built around a totally redesigned heater and oven that uses hybrid convection/conduction heating.  
### Why hybrid?  Here are the advantages:
- Denser and more flavorful results.
- Eliminates the need to stir.  Conduction heats from the outside, leaving the inside uncooked, while convection heats from the inside, leaving the outside uncooked.  The Firewood 7 uses both to get even results.
- Less Cleaning.  The screen is effectively a conduction heat source which means there is little to no resin buildup in the over/heater.

## Other features include:
- Super Fast Heat Up Times - Results in less than 20 seconds
- Works with popular 3rd party cooling stems with an 8mm (0.315") inside diameter and up to 12.7mm (0.5") outside diameter. (Includes adapter)
- Uses standard high drain 18650 cells (charged externally)
- 3 User programmable temperature settings
- Fully retractable mouthpiece
- Glass/Ceramic vapor path
- Vibration feedback, no distracting lights
- Discreet pocketable form factor
- Made in the USA (MA)
- 1 year limited warranty as detailed in the manual
- Black Walnut has a natural color that can range from medium to very dark brown and can potentially show a large range of colors within one piece.

### Finishes:  All units comes with 1 coat of 100% natural beeswax/oil finish.
