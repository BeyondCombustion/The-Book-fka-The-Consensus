# Is there a way to adjust the temperature setting ranges (fw3/4)?  Yes, here is how to change Firewood 3/4 temperature settings in 7 degree increments.

1. turn on the device
2. wait until battery indicator buzzes are done
3. click the button 8 times
4. the device will make 8 quick buzzes
5. click the button 5 times
6. the device will make 5 quick buzzes
7. click the button between 0 and 8 times:
  0 clicks = set temp shift to 0
  1 click = set temp shift to approx +7 degrees F for all heat levels
  2 clicks = set temp shift to approx +14 degrees F for all heat levels
  3 clicks = set temp shift to approx +21 degrees F for all heat levels

# How Do You Recommend Finishing the Firewood?

Only 100% natural oil and oil/wax mixes are recommended.  Good choices include Tung Oil and Mineral Oil optionally mixed with beeswax and/or carnauba wax.  A good place to start is by doing a web search for "cutting board finishes" or "food safe finishes."  The Milk Paint Company makes a good Tung oil and Tung Oil/Citrus Solvent mix that works well.  Mineral Oil can be purchased at a pharmacy.

Remove all ceramic parts before finishing (except heater).  When applying oil, use a qtip or small rag to evenly coat all exterior surfaces taking caution not to get oil on the ceramic heater.  Allow oil to soak for approximately half an hour then wipe clean with a rag or paper towel.  Allow oil to dry before use.
