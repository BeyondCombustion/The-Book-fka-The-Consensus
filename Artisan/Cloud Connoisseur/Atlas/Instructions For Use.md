# Instructions For Atlas:
 
## Before first use do a 30 minute “burn off” at 9 volts DO NOT USE AT THIS TIME it is to remove any factory residues.
 
- When heating up for the first-time place voltage on power supply at 12V for 10 minutes to ensure fully heat soaked. Heat up may be less time.
- Load bowl so heater does not touch the herb mixes with a light tamp.
- Place device on bowl.
- Inhale through water filtration device & remove bowl when finished to clear water filtration device.
- If results weren’t sufficient, raise the voltage by .1 wait a couple of minutes try step 3 & 4 again.
- Empty herb mix from bowl when contents have expired.
- Clean screen of debris.
