# Instructions For Halo:

## Before first use do a 30 minute “burn off” at 9 volts DO NOT USE AT THIS TIME it is to remove any factory residues.
 
- When heating up for the first-time place voltage on power supply at 7.5 for 10 minutes to ensure fully heat soaked. Heat up may be less time.
- Load bowl so heater does not touch the herb mixes with a light tamp.
- Place device on bowl.
- Inhale through water filtration device & remove bowl when finished to clear water filtration device.
- If results weren’t sufficient, raise the voltage by .1 wait a couple of minutes try step 3 & 4 again.
- Empty herb mix from bowl when contents have expired.
- Clean screen of debris.
 
 
# MAKERS NOTE 
I run the Halo more on the hot side at 9.1V when doing this the device can overheat soak at the screen above the heater mass.

So before loading the bowl I skip step 2 and hit with the bowl empty for a second or two just to get rid of the extra heat and be safe of no combustion. 

This only needs to be done if it has been heat soaking for long periods of time or from the initial heat soak at the 9.1V. 

Every device will be slightly different, and act differently based on speed of inhale so it would be best to start at 8.5 with this method and work your way up.
