The Advanced Telemetry Module is a Lab designed 3D-printed dual bay DC-DC buck/stepdown module housing which seamlessly adapts one or more UCTronics Buck Modules into a sleek, compact, and powerful desktop variable voltage power controller. 

The ATM is the world's first economically-minded, advanced multi-heater controller offering world class precision and accuracy. 

These controllers do not suffer from voltage drift, are very easy to install and use, and offer huge flexibility and power.

## The ATM Delivers:

- Advanced discrete multi-core control with accuracy to +/- .01V/,01A./01W
- Digitally controlled and saved output is immune to voltage drift caused by component tolerance
- Compatibility with other 12v heaters like Vapbong*, Herborizer, Woodscents & more!
- Supports up to 5 amps per channel and up to 10 amps max combined with an adequate supply
- Programmable OverVolt, OverAmp, Constant Current, Constant voltage, Memory presets
- Monitors input / supply voltage
- Monitors output Voltage, Amperage, and Wattage
- 2x programmable preset shortcuts for "runtime" and "boost" modes!
- 10x total presets for various device profiles
- Sits upright (desk mode) or tilted back (coffee table mode)
- Takes one screwdriver and 10 minutes to assemble
- Runs on any DC power source up to 50v with sufficient ampacity
- Passively vented
- 1 Pair detent release holes per slot (to remove the module as needed)

### What comes with an ATM from REFC :
- One ATM shell of your choice, 
- and the necessary (2 or 3) DC jacks to populate it

### What you need in addition: 
- (1 or 2) [Stepdown converters](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01LWXAC5E), 
- a [sufficient PSU](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09H5RKP4G)
- [and M-M cables](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B089CRGKJK) 

### If you need to go over 11V with your heaters, you must get a PSU of 15V or higher. This 24V 6A is a good choice for HLT + a 12v heater. Dual HLT's can run from a 12v 10A supply. Supply should have a 5.5x2.5mm or 5.5x2.1mm male.

### See the last photo for the wiring diagram. Note that the upper bay output is disconnected to make things a bit clearer. Module 1 and 2 inputs are jumped between their respective plugs (duplex jumper wire included with kit).

#### *AOV/Collyland products use a 2.5mm female jack and require a 2.5mm male plug
