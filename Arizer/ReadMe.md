# Uses
## Devices Uses
Many aromatic botanicals can be vaporized for aromatherapy with positive results. By heating your favorite herbs and flowers to precise temperatures, the pleasing aromas, terpenes, and botanical compounds are released to promote/enhance energetic or relaxing environments.

### Aromatherapy
Our unique, original glass pod systems utilize the thermal qualities of pure food-grade ceramics and borosilicate glass to produce and deliver unmatched performance. Vaporize natural compounds directly from your legal organic botanicals to enjoy the flavours & aromas and maximize potency with no additives and no messy liquids. Just put a small amount of your botanicals in a removable glass attachment and enjoy!

### Herbal Vaporization
Warm your favorite botanicals to taste the terpenes in an oxygen-rich vapor without ingesting unhealthy carcinogens released by combustion.
