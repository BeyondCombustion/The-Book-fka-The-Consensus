## What is a Dry Herb Vape?

Vaporizers heat dry herb until the terpenes and cannabinoids become vapor. DynaVap devices provide better vapor quality and flavor than battery devices. The hit is smoother and free of smoke.

## How Do I Use a Dry Herb Vape Pen?

The basics of a DynaVap pen are pretty simple. You don't have to toy with different temperature settings or worry about battery life. Simply load the chamber (remember that less is more), heat the portable dry herb vaporizer and take a hit. DynaVap devices are designed with precise temperature control. Your pen will click when it reaches the optimal temperature for use.
