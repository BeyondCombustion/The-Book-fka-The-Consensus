# Hopper Labs
## NOTE: There is essentially no support for Hopper Labs products. While they're still "in business", they're really not. Nobody can get in contact and they're not completing a majority of warranty repairs. Some recent battery purchases shipped around 420 but that's probably all she wrote folks.....
