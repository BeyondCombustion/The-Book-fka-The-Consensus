Frequently, customers ask for advice on how to keep the Hopper in top condition. With more Hoppers in the wild, we believe it's important to provide our suggestions. We read through the forums, and we are intrigued by the techniques developed by Hopper users. However, while we admire some of the methods, we've seen damaged Hoppers returned to our warranty department, ruined through improper cleaning. So, to help prevent customers from voiding their warranty, we've developed some recommendations.

Because of the efficient vaporization and short vapor path, your Hopper does not need regular cleaning. Taking basic care to clear the chamber, front-end, and threads of plant material after each use will keep you up and running.

The Hopper's front-end has a durable, machine etched stainless steel screen. Not only does it not need to be replaced, but this screen is also designed to withstand scratching during cleaning. Scrape the screen with a small tool or unscrew your backend and use the end of your clip to remove leftover plant material.

# Front Screen

Once every few months, you might want to perform a more extensive cleaning. Follow these steps to avoid any problems:

- Unscrew your front-end and place it in a sealed container of 99% isopropyl alcohol. 
- Leave soaking for 24 hours. 
- Ensure the front-end is completely dried off before putting it back on the Hopper.
- Dump out any herbs by lightly tapping your Hopper on a wood surface. 
- Take a dry q-tip and swab the inside of your chamber to remove any loose material that might be inside. 
- Never remove the screen in the bottom of your Hopper as this could damage the device.
- Turn your Hopper to temp 5 and draw through the device for 15-20 seconds. 
- Let cool for 2 minutes and repeat 2-3 times. This process will further dry out any plant material left behind and make it easier to remove.

We do not recommend using a solvent in your chamber. If the solvent leaks down the chamber, through the screen in the bottom, it could damage the device when you turn it on. If you do use a q-tip damp with 99% isopropyl alcohol, hold your Hopper with the chamber facing the ground as you clean. You must let your Hopper dry for 24 hours after this procedure. Failure to do this could cause it to stop working.

Clean the threads on the front end with a microfiber cloth damp with 99% isopropyl alcohol. Do not let excess solvent leak down into the chamber.

# Back-end Thread Cleaning

We've had several questions about cleaning the threads on the back-end of the device. 

Due to the nature of metal threads, over time you could experience some amount of corrosion. 

The flow of electrons, exposure to the environment, and action of the threads all can contribute to corrosion. 

However, it is unlikely to cause your device to malfunction and is not a major issue.

## Back-End

For users looking to get every last drop of power out of their device, a quick cleaning of the threads could be useful. Users have written in about their methods for doing this and here is our run down.

### Isopropyl alcohol (Not a Good Idea)

We do not recommend cleaning the threads with this or any other liquid solvent. Solvents can make their way into the back-end easily and cause problems if not fully evaporated before use.

### Blu-tack (Maybe Okay) - This pressure sensitive adhesive is a putty that sticks to itself. Formally made by Bostik, it is reportedly non-toxic and can be used to lift built up corrosion or dirt from threads. We have not yet conducted a study of the effectiveness but can say that if it is not leaving a residue, it should not cause harm to your device.

### Dry Brush (Okay) - A small dry brush will work well to loosen any material that might be on your threads. You can then use a microfiber towel or similar to remove the material.
# Important DON'Ts:

- Do not get the bottom of your chamber wet. If you do, let your Hopper dry out for 24 hours before using.
- Do not use any conductive grease or other substance on your threads or back-end. While the application of this conductive grease in the proper way will not hurt your device, the tight tolerances make it very easy to create a short circuit, ruining your Hopper.
- Do not remove the screen from the front-end or chamber. Incorrect removal or installation could cause your device to stop working.

We hope our suggestions help everyone maintain their Hoppers. Have any other questions related to cleaning? Or have a topic you would like us to discuss? Email blog@grasshoppervape.com with your suggestions.
