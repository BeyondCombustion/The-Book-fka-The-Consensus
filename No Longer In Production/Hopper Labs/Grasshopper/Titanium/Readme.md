# Product Description
See the new Ti Performance Front-end here.
The Titanium Grasshopper is everything that the Stainless Grasshopper is, and more. 
The unique thermal properties of titanium allow for even greater performance in a package that’s identical in size, but more durable and lighter.

The mechanical button and dial impart a familiarity that makes operation second-nature.
