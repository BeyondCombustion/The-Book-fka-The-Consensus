# Blue-Tac for cleaning threads

I've been doing a bit of reading on titanium threads, turns out they are renowned for galling (wear caused by adhesion between sliding surfaces) which is the cause of dark dust build up. 

Apparently no lube will prevent this due to the nature of the material and the forces required. 

It's not promoted as good body material with flashlight users, apart from its durability and mass. 

Apparently blu-tac works well to clean out the dust and doing this often should extend the life of the threads.

Yeah, I'll give a blu-tac dab a go now. I also have some electronic cleaning polymer goop stuff which has been basically useless until now, but it's in storage. I think blue tac is possibly the quickest solution seeing how difficult it is to wipe the fine threads.

...well I gave it a go, not because I needed to but because I wanted an excuse for some kush ;)
It works perfectly, requires little effort too.
You can also use it to clean the notches and +\- pretty effectively.

Terrible macro shot but the gist is there.
I had rarely cleaned my other hoppers back end as it stays cool, but it had a lot more dust in it. It can act as an abrasive agent destroying the threads so it's best cleaned out.


The kush was strong. It's too early in the day :tup::zzz:

I went to town. It's kind of like playing with play-dough and not half bad after a few chambers :cool:

The +/- leave cool embossed patterns. I should have taken a photo with that in it, but I only have an old phone so gave up by that point.

Initially, just before the photo I took, I just got a fresh slab of Bostik Blu-tac (it's worth it to get Bostik) and stuck it to the threads and pulled it off, applying minimal pressure. 

You can see there is black grime on the badly photographed/coloured blu-tac which shows a stripe representing the threads. 

It cleaned about 90% of the gunk from the threads in that one quick dab, I then proceeded to apply pressure and movement and then moved on to the +/- which were much grimier and more reluctant to be cleaned.

I then did my other back end which had about 3x as much grit. After cleaning it it is noticeably a lot smoother to twist on/off, possibly cleaner than I ever remember either hopper :)

I'd expect sticky keyboard cleaners would work as well or better though Blu-tac has much less scent (still strange smelling, it also stretches to be white in colour, as it has done a bit in my pic) it's also non-volatile and non-toxic but it tastes pretty terrible

PS I guess blu-tac isn't a common household item the world over? How do you guys stick up posters? @JoeMama

PPS lol I just remembered I also tried cleaning the air intake holes (pointless, no yield) and the mouth piece hole. The blu-tac kind of congeals with resin and I would not recommend doing this :sherlock:



My plain Ti is currently doing this. Probably not 20s but longer than normal. Mine's in the process of dying and the same symptoms graced it before it failed me last time with sensor issues. At the moment I'm getting occasional power failures
