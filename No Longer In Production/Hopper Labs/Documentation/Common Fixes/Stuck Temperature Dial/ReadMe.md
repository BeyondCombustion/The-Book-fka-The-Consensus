# Fix For a Stuck Temperature Dial

[Vapor_Eyes said:](https://fuckcombustion.com/goto/post?id=1099723)

I've been holding off on filing another warranty claim for my SS with the stuck temp dial. 
It randomly got stuck somehow and I could only adjust the temp by taking off the backend, and it was very hard to adjust even then. 
Most mysteriously, the small gap at the bottom of the temp dial was gone.

The Grasshopper itself was still functioning really well and so I didn't want to send it in, plus I'm lazy so I haven't done anything about it. 
I was planning on contacting HL soon, but I just decided to have a go at fixing it. 
I didn't expect success honestly, but I'm happy to report that I actually solved the problem! 
I tried a few different things, this is what worked.

I removed the backend from the body. 
I pressed in the spring loaded battery contact as far as I could. 
Then, while keeping the contact pressed in, I repeatedly pressed the clicker. 
I would occasionally rotate/spin the clicker itself, when it was in both the on and off positions.

I did this for a minute, I was about to give up, and to my amazement, the temp dial popped back up and the gap was back. 
It seemed to be adjusting better but was still a little stiff. 
I put it back on the body, and while screwing it in the temp dial gap disappeared again and I couldn't adjust it. :hmm:

I repeated this process another time or two with the same results, the gap would reappear until I put the backend on the body, at which point I would be back to square one. I was starting to think it was hopeless.

With nothing to lose I decided to get more aggressive with rotating the clicker, even doing it while I was clicking. 
After a short time doing this I heard a little click and felt something move. 
I tested the temp dial and it was much smoother than it was after the previous "fixes". 
I placed it back on the body and to my surprise the gap remained and I was able to adjust the temp without removing the backend.

Who knows how long this fix will last. I'm picturing the backend popping open like a broken pen in the future. 
I hope that never happens, but to be honest my hopper's clickers have always felt a little spongy and wonky. 
I don't like how the clicker freely rotates either. I wish it felt more solid in that regard.
