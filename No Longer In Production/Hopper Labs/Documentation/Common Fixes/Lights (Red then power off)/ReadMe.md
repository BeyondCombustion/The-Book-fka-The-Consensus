# Troubleshooting Grasshopper Turning Off After Red Light

Typically, the red then off issue is caused by either the Body or Back End. 
If it is a Back End issue, this is caused by a pin shifting out of place and can be corrected when you press and hold the button down while the red LED is on. 
If the red LED continues to turn off, it is a Body issue. 
If you have more than one hopper (my insert), ...please play around with this a bit and swap parts to determine which part needs to be replaced. 
Press and hold the button all the way down while the red LED is on and see if it turns blue. 
If not, it seems most likely that your Body is causing this issue.
