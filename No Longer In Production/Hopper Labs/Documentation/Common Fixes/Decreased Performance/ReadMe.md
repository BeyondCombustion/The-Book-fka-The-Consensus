# Fixes For Decreased Performance:

## [johnnyCanuck said:](https://fuckcombustion.com/goto/post?id=1004307)

Let me know if anyone has noticed this: quite often, I know my battery is fairly fresh, the blue lights will flicker during my draw instead of being solid blue and heat productions is slightly lower. 

Well, after screwing the back end (not the heat adjust) back and forth about three times, the lights stop flickering and heat up is normal. 

That and the battery lasts longer!!!

And I get to try that fix for the flickering blue lights... Thanks so much for that tip @johnnyCanuck !

So...first test failed, but the battery died mid test. 

So when I went to swap out batteries, I noticed a little "dirt" on the end of the battery. I was able to scrape it off with my thumbnail.

Then I looked at the end of the gh (the contact point for the battery). 

And there was more gunk there. I was able to remove that stuff with my thumbnail too.

Replaced the battery and took it for a test run. And no more flickering blue lights!

Moral of the story... In addition to @johnnyCanuck's twisting solution, look for buildup on the end battery contact point (and on the battery), and remove.

Happy hopping!

Since receiving my new backend from HL, my Hopper has been working like normal.

Sometimes good, sometimes not so good.

Never had any flashing lights or had it RMA'd in the over 3 years of ownership.

I was reading in the io thread about keeping the back threads super clean to allow the power to flow.

Broke out the stik-tac and went to cleaning! Still saw some black spots in the threads...

I found a dental scraper that fit in the t=grooves perfectly! Rotated the hopper and under a magnifier I could see the small chunks of debris being lifted from the threads. It was spotless when I was done.

I repeated the process on the new backend as well. The parts mated smooth like butter for a change!!

Slipped in a battery and charged using the mag charger and my PC USB.


This hopper has always been a use at 5 or why bother type device...

At 4 I used to get whispy vapor and anything under that, nothing but taste.


Using it today I am blown away by it again!

I load and do a heat up and allow the blue lights to stay on for a count of 5.

Click off and wait for a count of 5 and then turn on again and rip!

Almost instant vapor and I can now use it at 3.5 and get vapor and great taste!!

Think I will leave it like this and keep the other 2 batteries for the IO until the new ones come in.

My OG SS Hopper is performing like a new unit again.

I have not done a total bowl for the battery count but after 5, double heat bowls I was a baked potato!

The battery was still good and very little light flicker.

If you can magnify and pick out the back threads 100%, do it!!

it will change your experience!
