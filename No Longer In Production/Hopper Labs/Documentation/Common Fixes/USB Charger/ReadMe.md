# Fixes For Malfunctioning USB Charger:

## [crazferret said:](https://fuckcombustion.com/goto/post?id=1007666)

I once again attached my charger to the Hopper. As soon as the magnet attached to my Hopper, it lit up red for a second then went dark. I tried unplugging the device into a different outlet, etc. No luck. I thought maybe the light function wasn't working, but it may still be charging. I left my Hopper plugged in for a while. When I came back to it, the Hopper was still dead.

I purchased additional batteries. I put a fresh one in and resumed using my Hopper. Showing me the Hopper is still working well, but the charger doesn't.

I thought I had a solution when Caroline responded, "You can try plugging your Charger into the device and the USB port. Then, leaving your Hopper and Charger attached, disconnect the Charger from the USB port and then reconnect it to the USB port. If you still only see 1 red light, please log in to your account on GHVape.com, register your device, and submit a warranty request."

# Keep your charger clean and free of metal debris, keep in mind that it is magnetic.

Unfortunately, in my case, I think the magnet used to connect the hoppers charger, is prone to picking up bits of conductive metal material in a messy shop environment like mine.

I can see all kinds of "stuff" stuck to the end of the charger after touching my bench. This could be the problem anyways... lol

External is the way to go for me.

Update: After trying to wipe my USB chargers clean with iso to remove metal debris unsuccessfully lol, I finally used compressed air and just blew both charger magnets clean with an air wand.

Both worked like new again after doing this.

Still loving these hoppers.
