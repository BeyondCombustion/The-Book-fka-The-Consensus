# The Lotus
## Lotus

The Lotus is a portable vaporizer that uses a jet torch for its heat source.

Its design separates the flame and its fumes from the air you inhale. 
The air passes through a bowl beneath the heat exchanger( the blue ring), becoming vapor.
The vapor is cooled by the aluminum stem as it passes through.

The heat exchanger slides onto the bowl and is held there with magnets.

Heat-up time is about 2 seconds and cool-down time is instantaneous.

The Lotus is made of maple, stainless steel, nickel and hard anodized aluminum. 
Thanks to the design and construction, there are no metal, plastic or wood flavors in the vapor.

The user adjusts the vaporizing temp by varying his/her inhalation speed and the flame location. 
A 'hot spot' on the heat exchanger gives visual feedback of the vaporization temperature, shortening the learning curve.
