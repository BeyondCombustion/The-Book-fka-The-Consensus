Introduced in September 2010 and discontinued in Feburary 2021, The Lotus is a portable vaporizer that uses a jet torch for its heat source.

Its design separates the flame and its fumes from the air you inhale. 
The air passes through a bowl beneath the heat exchanger( the blue ring), becoming vapor.
The vapor is cooled by the aluminum stem as it passes through.

The heat exchanger slides onto the bowl and is held there with magnets.

Heat-up time is about 2 seconds and cool-down time is instantaneous.

The Lotus is made of maple, stainless steel, nickel and hard anodized aluminum. 
Thanks to the design and construction, there are no metal, plastic or wood flavors in the vapor.

The user adjusts the vaporizing temp by varying his/her inhalation speed and the flame location. 
A 'hot spot' on the heat exchanger gives visual feedback of the vaporization temperature, shortening the learning curve.

## Note from the lotusvaporizer.com blog 
#### Posted by Steven Levin on Feb 5th 2016

I became interested in vaporizers in 2007. I looked at the then available butane powered vaporizers and thought that I could make one that is healthier and faster operating. Three years and 12 prototypes later the first Lotus was ready to sell. I thought then that the Lotus was perfect and couldn't be improved. Now I realize that there is no perfect model and that the Lotus will always be improving. I hope you enjoy the present versions.

## Lotus Company Closing Notification to Customers

I want to thank you for being a loyal Lotus customer. I will be retiring soon and shutting down the Lotus company as it now exists. There will shortly be a presence on eBay to keep everyone supplied with maintenance items: screens, hot plates, etc. If you are thinking of buying a cap or WPA, please do it soon while stock is available. The company may exist with another owner in the future but that is not assured. 

Thanks for a great 10+ years,
